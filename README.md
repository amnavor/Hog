# Hog
Synopsis
-------------
Hog is a dice game where the first player to 100 points wins. You may roll up 
to ten dice on each turn, but if you roll a 1, you lose all but one point 
for that turn.  Other rules include swapping points with your opponent if your 
scores are palindromes of one other (ie: 16 and 61). More rules are included in 
documenation in Hog.py. This file also includes examples of strategies and the 
statistical predictions of those plays.

This file is written in Python. This project was for the UC Berkeley CS61A
course.
