# Hog
Synopsis
-------------
Hog is a dice game based around probability and risk taking. Your goal is 
to reach a certain total score (default: 100) by rolling dice with high 
numbers. However, there are many caveats. On each turn, you may roll up to 
ten dice, but if you roll any ones, you lose all but one point for that turn.
Other rules include swapping points with your opponent if your scores are 
palindromes of one other (ie: 16 and 61). More rules are included in 
documenation in Hog.py. This file also includes examples of strategies 
and the statistically predicted results of those plays.

This file is written in Python. This project was for the UC Berkeley CS61A
course; therefore, staff files like tests and GUI files are not included
